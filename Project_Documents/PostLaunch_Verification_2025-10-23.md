## üìä VERIFICATION TIMELINE

### Phase 1: Deployment (Estimated: 30-60 minutes)
1. Deploy website to hosting provider
2. Configure custom domain
3. Install SSL certificate
4. Configure DNS records

### Phase 2: DNS Propagation (Estimated: 5 min - 48 hours)
1. Wait for DNS to propagate globally
2. Verify with: https://www.whatsmydns.net/#A/ahkstrategies.com
3. Check multiple global DNS servers

### Phase 3: Post-Deployment Verification (Estimated: 30 minutes)
1. Run DNS verification (nslookup)
2. Test HTTPS connectivity
3. Run Lighthouse audit
4. Verify sitemap.xml and robots.txt
5. Crawl all 17 routes
6. Test on multiple browsers
7. Test on mobile devices

---

## üîÑ NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Deploy Website**
   - Choose hosting provider (Vercel recommended)
   - Run deployment command
   - Follow provider's domain configuration steps

2. **Configure Domain**
   - If domain not registered: Register ahkstrategies.com
   - Add DNS records as instructed by hosting provider
   - Typical records needed:
     ```
     Type    Name    Value
     A       @       [IP from hosting provider]
     CNAME   www     [CNAME from hosting provider]
     ```

3. **Wait for Propagation**
   - DNS changes take time to propagate
   - Check status: https://www.whatsmydns.net
   - Typical wait: 15 minutes to 48 hours

4. **Re-run This Verification**
   - After deployment and DNS propagation
   - Use the same commands from this report
   - Document actual results
